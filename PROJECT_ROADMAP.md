- [x] ‚úÖ Enhanced categorisation metadata captured on each news item (primary & secondary categories, confidence scores).
- [x] ‚úÖ News extraction, enrichment, and deduplication flows driven by Gemini 2.5 models (`utils/news_extraction.py`, `utils/news_deduplication.py`).
- [x] ‚úÖ HTML newsletter generation, sanitisation, and delivery through Gmail (`utils/newsletter`).
- [x] ‚úÖ Pipeline telemetry surfaced via structlog and runtime stats returned from [`main.py`](./main.py).
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloud Run deployment with daily scheduling requires per-project configuration (scripts exist but no active service is bundled).
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Secret Manager-backed credential rotation and storage need project-specific secrets to be provisioned.
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Automated regression tests and CI remain to be implemented.
